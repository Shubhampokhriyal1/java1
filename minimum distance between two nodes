given N nodes and E edge of a undirectedgraph 
answer the Q query . where in each query find the minimum distance between a ,b . where a,b are nodes of a undirectedgraph

Input
The first line of each test contains a three integer N (1≤N≤100) — the number Nodes of the undirectedgraph ,  E (N-1 <= E <= N*(N-1)/2 ) - edges of the undirectedgraph and Q ( 1<=Q<=1000) -number of query

the Next E numbers of lines contains  two space seprated integer a (1<=a<=N) and b (1<=b<=N) the connected edges of undirectedgraph

followed by Q lines containes the two space seprated integer a (1<=a<=N) and b (1<=b<=N) query

OUTPUT 
output consist of Q lines where ith line answerse ith query
